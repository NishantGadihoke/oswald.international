								<h1>Kaksha</h1>
								<p>Over two years before Nishant and I came together at AngelHack Delhi to build our first accessibility tool, I started an edtech company called Class Rebels, with a mission to "study, but with difference." We wanted to build a platform that empowers students with the best-quality study material online.</p>
								<p>While revisiting our mistakes, we realized that since Class Rebels already has one of the best curated collections of copyright-free study material, we can use Oswald technology to make it accessible. Imagine an online classroom that has access to the best-quality education content, and is also accessible to students with visual impairment, learning disorders, etc. And that’s just what we’re going to build.</p>
