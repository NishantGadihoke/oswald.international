								<h1>Agastya</h1>
								<p>Agastya is a solution for web developers to help incorporate accessibility features in their websites. By adding just one line of JavaScript code, you can make your website accessible to a much wider audience. You can customize the widget, view usage anayltics, and more.</p>
								<p>Agastya is also helpful for people with dyslexia, because it comes built-in with an option that adjusts the color-contrast ratio and typography to best suit the needs of someone with a learning disorder, based on previous research conducted by the W3C and the British Dyslexia Association.</p>
