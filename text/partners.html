								<h1>Partners</h1>
								<p>As part of our partnership with <strong><a href="http://classrebels.co">Class Rebels</a></strong>, we're building India's largest accessible education space online where students can access high-quality study material for free.</p>
								<p>We are working with <strong><a href="https://www.justiceadda.com">Justice Adda</a></strong>, a part of Cambridge Social Ventures, to make hundreds of websites and apps related to human rights, justice, and freedom accessible.</p>
								<p><strong><a href="https://unifiers.in">Unifiers</a></strong> is a social infrastructure organization trying to train and employ India's youth, and our partnership is helping build large-scale free and accessible portals for online training.</p>
								<p>We also work with <strong><a href="http://art4edu.in">Art4Education</a></strong> to support the living and education costs of orphan children with Oswald Foundationâ€™s funding. When you make a donation, a part of it goes to A4E.</p>
								<p>If you have a product or organization that can help us make the next accessibility solution, feel free to <a href="mailto:hello@oswald.foundation">write to us</a> to explore partnership opportunities.</p>
