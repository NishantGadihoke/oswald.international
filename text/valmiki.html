								<h1>Valmiki</h1>
								<p>Oswald Foundation was founded with the development of Valmiki, which is a plug-in for Chromium-based web browsers like Google Chrome and Opera that changes the look and feel of the entire internet based on your preferences.</p>
								<p>Valmiki is especially helpful for people with dyslexia, because it comes built-in with an option that adjusts the color-contrast ratio and typography to best suit the needs of someone with a learning disorder, based on previous research conducted by the W3C and the British Dyslexia Association.</p>
