								<h1>Justice</h1>
								<p><strong>We want to make justice accessible.</strong> Thousands of court cases have been locked up and are unavailable to people who, say, cannot read. We've partnered with <a href="https://www.justiceadda.com">Justice Adda</a>, a part of the Cambridge Social Ventures programme in the Centre for Social Innovation at Cambridge Judge Business School, to make justice accessible. We provide accessibility technology solutions to them for free.</p>
								<p>If you have a product or organization that can help us make justice accessible, feel free to <a href="mailto:hello@oswald.foundation">write to us</a> to explore partnership opportunities.</p>
